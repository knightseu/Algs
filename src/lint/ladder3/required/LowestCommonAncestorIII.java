/*
Given the root and two nodes in a Binary Tree. Find the lowest common ancestor(LCA) of the two nodes.
The lowest common ancestor is the node with largest depth which is the ancestor of both nodes.
Return null if LCA does not exist.

 Notice

node A or node B may not exist in tree.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
For the following binary tree:

  4
 / \
3   7
   / \
  5   6
LCA(3, 5) = 4

LCA(5, 6) = 7

LCA(6, 7) = 7
