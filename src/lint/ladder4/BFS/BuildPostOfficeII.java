/*
Given a 2D grid, each cell is either a wall 2, an house 1 or empty 0 (the number zero, one, two), find a place to build a post office so that the sum of the distance from the post office to all the houses is smallest.

Return the smallest sum of distance. Return -1 if it is not possible.

 Notice

You cannot pass through wall and house, but can pass through empty.
You only build post office on an empty.
Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
